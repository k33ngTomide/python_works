                ESTP is someone with the Extraverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. 
                They tend to be energetic and action-oriented, deftly navigating whatever is in front of them.

                They love uncovering life’s opportunities, whether socializing with others or in more personal pursuits.
                ESTPs always have an impact on their immediate surroundings – 
                the best way to spot them at a party is to look for the whirling eddy of people flitting about 
                them as they move from group to group. Laughing and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor, 
                ESTP personalities love to be the center of attention. If an audience member is 
                asked to come on stage, ESTPs volunteer – or volunteer a shy friend.

                Theory, abstract concepts and plodding discussions about global issues and their 
                implications don’t keep ESTPs interested for long. ESTPs keep their conversation energetic, 
                with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what is – or better yet, 
                to just go out and do it. ESTPs leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go, 
                rather than sitting idle, preparing contingencies and escape clauses.

                ESTPs are the likeliest personality type to make a lifestyle of risky behavior. 
                They live in the moment and dive into the action – they are the eye of the storm. 

                People with the ESTP personality type enjoy drama, passion, and pleasure, not for emotional 
                thrills, but because it’s so stimulating to their logical minds. They are forced to make 
                critical decisions based on factual, immediate reality in a process of rapid-fire

                own sensible judgment. They often serve as a stabilizing force among others, 
                able to offer solid direction amid adversity.

                ESTJs are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding of

                lead by example, demonstrating dedication and purposeful honesty, and an utter rejection of 
                laziness and cheating, especially in work. If anyone declares hard, manual work to be an 
                excellent way to build character, it is ESTJs.

                ESTJs are aware of their surroundings and live in a world of clear, verifiable facts – 
                the surety of their knowledge means that even against heavy resistance, they stick to their 
                principles and push an unclouded vision of what is and is not acceptable. Their opinions 
                aren’t just empty talk either, as ESTJs are more than willing to dive into the most 
                challenging projects, improving action plans and sorting details along the way, 
                making even the most complicated tasks seem easy and approachable.

                However, ESTJs don’t work alone, and they expect their reliability and work ethic to be 
                reciprocated – people with this personality type meet their promises, and if partners or 
                subordinates jeopardize them through incompetence or laziness, or worse still, dishonesty, 
                they do not hesitate to show their wrath. This can earn them a reputation for inflexibility, 
                a trait shared by all Sentinel personalities, but it’s not because ESTJs are arbitrarily 
                stubborn, but because they truly believe that these values are what make society work.""")

                community. Their achievements are guided by decisive values, and they willingly offer guidance to others.
                Encourage, lift, and strengthen one another. For the positive energy spread to one will be felt by us all.
                For ESFJs, life is sweetest when it’s shared with others. People with this personality 
                type form the bedrock of many communities, opening their homes – and their hearts – 
                to friends, loved ones, and neighbors.

                This doesn’t mean that ESFJs like everyone, or that they’re saints. But ESFJs do believe 
                in the power of hospitality and good manners, and they tend to feel a sense of duty to 
                those around them. Generous and reliable, people with this personality type often take it 
                upon themselves – in ways both large and small – to hold their families and their communities together.

                ESFJs have a talent for making the people in their lives feel supported, cared for, and secure.
                ESFJs are altruists. They take seriously their responsibilities to give back, serve others, 
                and do the right thing.

                And ESFJs believe that there is a clear right thing to do in nearly every situation. 
                While some personality types adopt a more lenient, live-and-let-live attitude, ESFJs may find 
                it difficult not to judge when someone takes a path that strikes them as misguided. As a result, 
                ESFJs often struggle to accept it when someone – particularly someone they care about – disagrees with them.

                ESFJs have a clear moral compass – and it can be nothing short of baffling to them 
                when other people’s actions don’t align with it.
                With their definite views on right and wrong, ESFJs tend to be on the opinionated side. 
                But these opinions aren’t arbitrary – they’re often based on a deep respect for tradition. 
                ESFJs know that everything they do affects someone else, and they trust that established laws, 
                protocols, and social norms will help them navigate their everyday lives in a way

                discovering the unknown. They can be very social, often encouraging others 
                into shared activities.

                If anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it is the ESFP 
                personality type. ESFPs get caught up in the excitement of the moment, and want everyone 
                else to feel that way, too. No other personality type is as generous with their time and energy 
                as ESFPs when it comes to encouraging others, and no other personality type does 
                it with such irresistible style.

                ESFPs love the spotlight, and all the world’s a stage. Many famous people with the 
                ESFP personality type are indeed actors, but they love putting on a show for their friends too,
                chatting with a unique and earthy wit, soaking up attention and making every outing feel a 
                bit like a party. Utterly social, ESFPs enjoy the simplest things, and there’s no greater 
                joy for them than just having fun with a good group of friends.

                It’s not just talk either – ESFPs have the strongest aesthetic sense of any personality type. 
                From grooming and outfits to a well-appointed home, ESFP personalities have an eye for fashion. 
                Knowing what’s attractive the moment they see it, ESFPs aren’t afraid to change their 
                surroundings to reflect their personal style. ESFPs are naturally curious, exploring 
                new designs and styles with ease.

                Though it may not always seem like it, ESFPs know that it’s not all about them – 
                they are observant, and very sensitive to others’ emotions. People with this personality 
                type are often the first to help someone talk out a challenging problem, happily providing 
                emotional support and practical advice. However, if the problem is about them, ESFPs are more 
                likely to avoid a conflict altogether than to address it head-on. ESFPs usually love a little 
                drama and passion, but not so much when they are the focus of the criticisms it can bring.""")

                ENTJ exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment crisis management and navigating

                problem and not just resolving momentary issues, but moving the whole project forward 
                with their solutions. These qualities combine to create individuals who are able to inspire

                This personality type makes up a good portion of the overall population, and while 
                ISTJ may not be particularly flashy or attention-seeking, they do more than their share to keep

                personality type believe that there is a right way to proceed in any situation – and that 
                anyone who pretends otherwise is probably trying to bend the rules to suit their own purposes. 
                ISTJ have a deep respect for structure and tradition, and they are often drawn to organizations,

                personality traits. They tend to have open minds, approaching life, new experiences, 
                and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover 
                exciting potentials.

                ISFPs are true artists – although not necessarily in the conventional sense. For this 
                personality type, life itself is a canvas for self-expression. From what they wear to how they 
                spend their free time, ISFPs act in ways that vividly reflect who they are as unique individuals.
                And every ISFP is certainly unique. Driven by curiosity and eager to try new things, people 
                with this personality often have a fascinating array of passions and interests. With their 
                exploratory spirits and their ability to find joy in everyday life, ISFPs can be among the most 
                interesting people you’ll ever meet. The only irony? Unassuming and humble, ISFPs tend to see 
                themselves as “just doing their own thing,” so they may not even realize how remarkable 
                they really are.

                ISFPs embrace a flexible, adaptable approach to life. Some personality types thrive on 
                strict schedules and routines – but not ISFPs. ISFPs take each day as it comes, doing what 
                feels right to them in the moment. And they make sure to leave plenty of room in their lives 
                for the unexpected – with the result that many of their most cherished memories are of 
                spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment outings and adventures, whether by themselves 
                or with their loved ones.

                This flexible mindset makes ISFPs remarkably tolerant and open-minded. 
                These personalities genuinely love living in a world filled with all kinds of people 
                – even people who disagree with them or choose radically different lifestyles. It’s no 
                surprise, then, that ISFPs are unusually open to changing their minds and rethinking their 
                opinions. If any personality type believes in giving something (or someone) a second chance, 
                it’s ISFPs.

                ISFPs want to live in a world where they – and everyone else – have the freedom to live as 
                they see fit, without judgment.
                That said, ISFPs’ go-with-the-flow mentality can have its downsides. People with this 
                personality type may struggle to set long-term plans – let alone stick with them. 
                As a result, ISFPs tend to have a pretty cloudy view of their ability to achieve their goals, 
                and they often worry about letting other people down. ISFPs may find that adding a little 
                structure to their lives goes a long way toward helping them feel more capable and 
                organized – without quashing their independent spirits.""")

                An INTJ is a person with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality traits.
                These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and 
                rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one.
                Rational and quick-witted, INTJs pride themselves on their ability to think for themselves, 
                not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. But because 
                their minds are never at rest, Architects may struggle to find people who can keep up with 
                their nonstop analysis of everything around them.

                This personality type comes with a strong independent streak. INTJs don’t mind acting alone, 
                perhaps because they don’t like waiting around for others to catch up with them. They also 
                generally prefer making decisions without asking for anyone else’s input. At times, this 
                lone-wolf behavior can come across as insensitive, as it fails to take into consideration 
                other people’s thoughts, desires, and plans.

                Architects contemplate the strengths and weaknesses of each move before they make it. 
                And they never lose faith that, with enough ingenuity and insight, they can find a way to 
                win – no matter what challenges might arise along the way.

                INTJ personalities can be rational, informed, independent, determined curious, and original. 
                And some are their weaknesses is that they are arogant, dismissive of  emotions,

                They often seek out unlikely paths, mixing willingness to experiment with personal creativity.
                INTP often lose themselves in thought – which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. People with this 
                personality type hardly ever stop thinking. From the moment they wake up, their minds buzz with 
                ideas, questions, and insights. At times, they may even find themselves conducting full-fledged 
                debates in their own heads.

                People with this personality type want to understand everything in the universe, but one area 
                in particular tends to mystify them: human nature. As their name suggests, Logicians feel most 
                at home in the realm of logic and rationality. As a result, they can find themselves baffled 
                by the illogical, irrational ways that feelings and emotions influence people’s behavior – 
                including their own.

                Some of this personality strength is that they analyze everything that they come across, 
                from research data to the behavior of the people around them. Thanks to their unrelenting 
                imagination, Logicians can come up with creative, counterintuitive ideas that wouldn’t 
                occur to most people. Logicians are driven by curiosity and an intense desire to learn 
                everything that they can. These personalities are always casting about for new pursuits, 
                hobbies, and areas of research. they care about the truth. Rather than taking comfort in

                Although they may seem quiet or unassuming,  (INFPs) have vibrant, passionate inner lives. 
                Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of

                INFP can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them.
    
                Idealistic and empathetic, INFP long for deep, soulful relationships, and they feel called to 
                help others. But because this personality type makes up such a small portion of the population,
                 INFPs may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn’t seem to 
                 appreciate the traits that make them unique.
    
                Empathy is among this personality type’s greatest gifts, but at times it can be a liability. 
                The troubles of the world weigh heavily on INFP’ shoulders, and these personalities can be 
                vulnerable to internalizing other people’s negative moods or mindsets. Unless they learn to 
                set boundaries, INFP may feel overwhelmed by just how many wrongs there are

                uplifting others and their ability to feel other people’s suffering as if it were their own.

                 Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism 
                 guide them in all things.

                they are capable of being.”

                (INFJs) may be the rarest personality type of all, but they certainly leave their mark on 
                the world. Idealistic and principled, they aren’t content to coast through life – they want 
                to stand up and make a difference. For Advocate personalities, success doesn’t come 
                from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force 
                for good in the world.

                While they have lofty goals and ambitions, INFJs shouldn’t be mistaken for idle dreamers. 
                People with this personality type care about integrity, and they’re rarely satisfied until 
                they’ve done what they know to be right. Conscientious to the core, they move through life 
                with a clear sense of their values, and they aim never to lose sight of what truly matters – 
                not according to other people or society at large, but according to their own wisdom and intuition.

                Perhaps because their personality type is so uncommon, INFJs tend to carry around a sense – 
                whether conscious or not – of being different from most people. With their rich inner lives 
                and their deep, abiding desire to find their life purpose, they don’t always fit in with those 
                around them. This isn’t to say that Advocates can’t enjoy social acceptance or close 
                relationships – only that they sometimes feel misunderstood or at odds with the world.

                INFJ may be Introverted, but they value deep, authentic relationships with others. 
                Few things bring these personalities as much joy as truly knowing another person – and 
                being known in return. Advocates enjoy meaningful conversations far more than small talk, 
                and they tend to communicate in a way that is warm and sensitive""")
